			<h2>History and Government</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
		Legend has it that the municipality was first settled by a couple named Padoka and Adian in Pabis. To survive, the couple planted root crops to augment their provisions of food. Padoka also became a skillful hunter.
		</p>
		<p>
		Many years thereafter, a pregnant sow of the couple was nowhere to be found in its pen. The couple, together with their son and daughter, searched the vicinity for the missing sow. Later, Adian discovered that the sow headed eastward via a lower dike-like mountain. They followed the footprints going to Mt. Kipay-an until they found it in a cave at the side near the spring. The place was luxuriant with “Baukok” trees (Specie Garnica). Because the land on which the “Baukok” grew had a friendly terrain, Padoka decided to transfer his whole family there.
		</p>
		<p>
		Time came when there was rampant cutting down of trees by the inhabitants, who had become by then numerous, to make houses. To perpetuate the memory of the specie of trees that once abounded in the area, Opeg’s descendants called it Baukok, which was shortened to Bauko later on for euphony. This was how Bauko got its name.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are few explanations as to how the town evolved as a municipality. As per record, Bauko was created as a regular municipality in 1911. It was believed that the first municipal building was constructed at Bauko Poblacion. But this did not exist for long. The following year, the municipal hall was transferred to Guinzadan. In 1898, it was again transferred to Bauko Poblacion. In 1918, the municipal hall was built below the Central School but again later transferred along the Bontoc-Cervantes National Road. Unfortunately, this was bombed during World War II.
